## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 2, 2026**

### 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how ‘momo’ (hereinafter referred to as the "App") handles user information. The App provides features to scan images and extract text using the camera. We prioritize an **On-device** processing approach, meaning your data is processed locally on your device.

### 2. Information Collection and Use

* **Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or contact information, to any external servers.
* **Images and Video:** Images captured or imported for text extraction are deleted from the system cache immediately after the extraction process is complete. Extracted text and user-written memos are stored exclusively in the device's local storage and are never sent to our servers.
* **Diagnostic Information:** We do not use any third-party analytics tools or collect diagnostic data.

### 3. Device Permissions

* **Camera:** Required to capture text from physical documents or books for extraction.
* **Storage:** Required to import images from the gallery for text extraction or to save memos locally on the device.

### 4. Advertising and Third-Party Services

**Currently, the App does not contain any advertisements.** In the future, advertisements (such as Google AdMob) may be introduced for service maintenance and operation. In such cases, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect the changes.

### 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 6. Data Retention

We do not store user data on any servers. All records are stored on the user's device; therefore, please be aware that deleting the App may result in the loss of your saved data.

### 7. Security

We request only the minimum permissions necessary for the App's functionality and adhere to Android platform security guidelines to protect your data.

### 8. User Rights

Users can withdraw permissions (Camera, Storage) at any time through their device settings. You can also manage all your data by directly deleting saved memos within the App. Please note that withdrawing essential permissions may limit the App's core functionality.

### 9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in laws or service features. Any significant changes will be notified by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page or through an in-app notice.
